## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure Javascript

### What I learned

In this project I used tailwind css for the first time and learned a lot about it. I had some challenges like how to update the prices when user changes
the term of the plan, how to build a custom checkbox, how to move between steps of the form, etc. And by solving these problems, I made some progress.
